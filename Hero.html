<P> I would not say I necessarily have a "hero" but if I had to pick, I would say one of my role models for volleyball is Kerri Walsh Jennings. Kerri Walsh Jennings is a 42 year volleyball and beach volleyball player, she was born in Santa Clara, California. She went to Stanford University and graduated 2001. She is a five-time Olympian, after winning bronze in 2016 she became the most decorated beach volleyball player of all-time (three gold medals and one bronze). There are only three U.S. beach volleyball players who have won more than one Olympic medal, these other two players were both partners of hers. She and Misty May Treanor won 21 consecutive Olympic matches and only lost one set (Austria in 2012) during their 11-year run together.

<p> The reason I chose Kerri Walsh Jennings is because I admire all she has done in the volleyball world. In many aspects I can never be like her, but in some I can at  least hope to be. I want to go to Stanford like she did, and hopefully I'll be able to play volleyball then. If not I want to play recreational volleyball, I admire that she is still going to play professionally in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. She has done so many great things in volleyball, and it's amazing that she was able to make a profitable career out of something she had a passion for. I know that I can't be her, I probably won't even be able to play too much longer, but I hope that if I have not lost love for volleyball. That I can coach, and if not either I want my career to be one I enjoy.
